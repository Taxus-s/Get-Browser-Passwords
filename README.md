# Get-Browser-Passwords

Heavily borrowed from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-extract-chrome-passwords-in-python

Only for Windows computers

Takes stored passwords in the browser and decrypts them to be readable

I decided that chrome was not enough and wanted to extend to other browsers

Currently supports Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera
